# ðŸ”§ Homepage CTA & About Page Values Cards - FIXES COMPLETED

## ðŸ“‹ ISSUES ADDRESSED

### 1. **Homepage CTA Text Alignment Issue** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: "Ready to transform" text block was sitting at the bottom of the CTA card instead of being middle-aligned and centered on the left side.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Removed absolute positioning** from `.cta-title`, `.cta-divider`, and `.cta-buttons`
- **Implemented flexbox layout** for proper alignment:
  ```css
  .cta-content {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 0 40px;
  }
  
  .cta-title {
    flex: 1;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    max-width: 350px;
  }
  ```
- **Removed card-wide interactions** - only the "Partner With Us" button has hover effects now
- **Updated mobile responsive styles** to maintain proper layout on smaller screens

### 2. **About Page Values Cards Disappearing** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: The Our Values section cards were disappearing due to micro-interaction CSS that set `opacity: 0` without proper JavaScript activation.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Removed JavaScript animations** from values section in `micro-interactions-about.js`
- **Added CSS override** to force visibility:
  ```css
  .about-values-grid .about-value-card {
    opacity: 1 !important;
    transform: translateY(0) !important;
    transition: none !important;
  }
  ```
- **Preserved card styling** while removing problematic animations
