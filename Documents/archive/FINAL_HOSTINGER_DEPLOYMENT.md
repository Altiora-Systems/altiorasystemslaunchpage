## ðŸŽ¯ FINAL STEPS TO COMPLETE

### **Step 1: Choose Form Backend (REQUIRED)**

**Option A: Formspree (Recommended - 5 minutes setup)**
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create free account (1000 submissions/month)
3. Create two forms:
   - **Contact Form**: Name it "Altiora Contact Form"
   - **Product Notifications**: Name it "Product Launch Notifications"
4. Copy the form IDs (they look like `xpzgkdqw`)
5. **I'll update your HTML files with the real form IDs**

**Option B: Use Current Mailto System (Works immediately)**
- Forms will automatically open user's email client
- No additional setup required
- Less professional but functional

**Which do you prefer?** (I recommend Formspree)

### **Step 2: Upload to Hostinger**

**Files to Upload to your `public_html` directory:**
```
All files from this folder EXCEPT:
- *.md files (documentation)
- optimize-images.sh
- test-*.html files
- .git folder (if present)
```

**Upload Methods:**

**Method A: File Manager (Easiest)**
1. Log into Hostinger hPanel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to `public_html`
4. Upload all website files
5. Extract if uploaded as ZIP

**Method B: FTP (Advanced)**
1. Use FileZilla or similar FTP client
2. Connect to your Hostinger FTP
3. Upload all files to `public_html`

### **Step 3: Test Website**
After upload, test:
- [ ] All pages load correctly
