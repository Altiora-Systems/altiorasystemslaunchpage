# Note: This file is for Netlify deployment only
# For Hostinger (current deployment), redirects are handled in .htaccess

# If migrating to Netlify in the future, these rules would apply:
# /contact  /contact.html  200
# /home     /               301
# /home.html /              301
# /*        /404.html       404

# For current Hostinger deployment, see .htaccess for redirect rules
